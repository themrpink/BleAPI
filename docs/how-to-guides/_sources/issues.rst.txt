CosmedBleDevice is null

Although subscribable to indications, in the tests the following attribute produces an error when trying to subscribe to it: 
2a05  (00002a05-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb) (Service Changed characteristic) error read: Impossibile scrivere l'attributo. (Eccezione da HRESULT: 0x80650003)
the error is given: when trying to subscrite to indications or unsubscribe(whish is flagged as possible) 
this is the uwp method causing the exception:
WriteClientCharacteristicConfigurationDescriptorAsync(GattClientCharacteristicConfigurationDescriptorValue.Indicate)



Windows pairing
---------------

pairing: sometimes windows pairing window will appear asking to confirm a pin, but will usually fail pairing. 
If pairing fails without prompting then removing the remote device from the cached bluetooth devices may solve the issue.
